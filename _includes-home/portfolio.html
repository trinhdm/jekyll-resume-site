<h4>About</h4>
<p>
  <i>Foreground Studios</i>, a subsidiary of <i>Foreground Company</i>, is an up and rising media production team that specializes in photography, videography and other creative services. They have been featured in <i>City Gala 2016</i> at the Playboy Mansion, among many other events.
</p>

<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>
  Initially, I was brought onto the team as a marketing intern, where I helped out in creating and editing content for their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/foreground/re-inventing-the-basic-t-shirt-the-3d-overlay-tees">Kickstarter</a>.
  As the company migrated their goals towards forming a media team, I was given the opportunity to try my hand in Wordpress and Shopify development, as my mentor quickly realized my development skills exceeded their exceptions.
</p>

<p>As their sole web developer, I utilized Photoshop, Illustrator and Invision to wireframe and mock-up the website before proceeding with development.
  After designing a mock-up that rang well with everyone on the team, I used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP to craft a site that fit their needs.</p>

<p>This project has proved to be invaluable for understanding the complexity of developing a Wordpress Theme.
  It gave me great insight on how Wordpress worked in the front-end and back-end, and it also taught my how to work with clients.
  Through creating this theme, I have also taught myself PHP.</p>

<h4>About</h4>
<p>
<i>Chinese Association at UC Irvine</i> is a social, cultural, and community service-based club located at the University of California, Irvine. Their mission is to share Chinese and Chinese-American culture with the greater Orange County and Los Angeles area.
</p>

<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>
For the new Chinese Association website, my role was to wire-frame and design a website, and then convert those designs into a responsive WordPress theme. I worked closely
with the board members of Chinese Association to implement a design that fit their needs and their members' needs. This website was developed with HTML5, CSS3, jQuery
and PHP.
